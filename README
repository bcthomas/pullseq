Summary:
  pullseq: extract sequences from a fasta/fastq file.  This program is
  fast, and can be useful in a variety of situations.  You can use it to
  extract sequences from one fasta/fastq file into a new file, given
  either a list of header ids to include / exclude or a size minimum /
  maximum sequence lengths.

  Additionally, it can convert from fastq to fasta or visa-versa and
  can change the length of the output sequence lines.

  NOTE: pullseq prints to standard out, so you need to use redirection
  (e.g. pullseq input.fasta -m 10 *>* output.fasta ) to create output files.

Synopsis:
  # general extraction with a list of names
  pullseq --input=<input fasta/fastq file> --names=<fasta header ids file>
  
  # general extraction with a minimum size requirement
  pullseq --input=<input fasta/fastq file> --min=<minimum size sequence to extract>
  
  # only sequences with min 200 and max 500
  pullseq -i input.fasta -m 200 -a 500 > new.fasta

  Options:
    -i, --input,     Input fasta/fastq file (required)
    -n, --names,     File of header id names to select
    -m, --min,       Minimum sequence length
    -a, --max,       Maximum sequence length
    -l, --length,    Sequence characters per line (default 50)
    -c, --convert,   Convert input to fastq/fasta (e.g. if input is fastq, output will be fasta)
    -q, --quality,   ASCII code to use for fasta->fastq quality conversions
    -e, --excluded,  Exclude the header id names in the list (-n)
    -h, --help,      Display this help and exit
    -v, --verbose,   Print extra details during the run
    --version,       Output version information and exit

REQUIREMENTS:
  Pullseq requires a C compiler and has been tested to work with
  either GCC or clang. Pullseq also requires and includes kseq.h
  (Heng Li).

  Pullseq (actually kseq.h) also requires Zlib (so your linker
  should be able to handle the '-lz' option).  You can obtain zlib
  from http://www.zlib.net/ or commonly from your OS package manager
  (e.g. apt-get zlib or emerge zlib).

INSTALL:
  To install pullseq, do the following in a shell on your system...

  git clone https://github.com/bcthomas/pullseq.git # checkout the code using git
  cd pullseq
  ./bootstrap  # get set up for config/build after cloning
  ./configure  # configure the application based on your system
  make         # will build the application
  make install # will install in /usr/local by default
